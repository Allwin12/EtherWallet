The users will have two options.    
1. Create wallet
2. Import wallet

# Create wallet

   If we click on create wallet a wallet address will be generated. Each address will have a primary key and a mnemonic phrase that can be used to import our address on other wallets. A .txt file is generated which will hold our primary key and mnemonic phrase. Enter the name and save the .txt file. This will be helpful to import our address later, either on this wallet or other wallets.
   If we click on create wallet a prompt window appears which will enable us to specify the name of our .txt file.
The screen looks like this.
